# Development

Everything needed to work on MCP Tester: setup, the layout, the test suites, and how to run every CI gate locally. For what the project is, start with the [README](README.md); for how to propose a change, [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Setup

- Node.js 22 or later (see [`docs/POLICIES.md`](docs/POLICIES.md)).
- `npm install`. Playwright is the only dependency, and only for the end-to-end tests.
- For the end-to-end tests, a Chromium build: `npx playwright install chromium`, or point `PW_CHROMIUM_PATH` at one (then only that one is tried). Without it those tests skip locally; with `CI=true` they fail, so a broken browser install cannot hide UI regressions in CI.

The `Makefile` wraps the npm scripts (`make help` lists every target), so either works:

```sh
make check              # test + trace + readme + build: everything CI's test job checks, offline
make lint               # markdownlint and codespell
make docs               # the user manual in build/manual-site (needs: pip install --require-hashes -r docs/manual/requirements.txt)
npm run dev             # local server on http://127.0.0.1:8787; restarts on core/host changes, UI edits show on reload
npm run mock            # mock MCP server on http://127.0.0.1:8788/mcp
npm test                # all suites
npm run test:trace      # acceptance-criteria traceability
npm run check:readme    # README structure check
npm run build           # regenerate dist/
```

Edit `src/`, never `dist/`: `dist/` is generated and ignored by git. How the pieces fit is in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Test suites

`npm test` runs every suite with Node's built-in runner:

- **proxy**: the core against a mock server. Covers timing, timeouts, retries with backoff, network failures, Accept repair, header filtering and the allowlist. It also covers the mock server's scenario registry: discovery, the original paths as aliases, parallel instances, the delay knob, and that each violation scenario breaks the rule it names.
- **hosts**: both Cloudflare bundles, executed as built, and the local server, including its security checks.
- **ui-logic**: the shipped client JS in a VM. Covers the percentile and uptime maths, flap streaks, schema-based request suggestions and JSON-RPC ids.
- **e2e**: Chromium drives the real UI through the local server to the mock MCP server. Covers both protocol eras, OAuth sign-in (pop-up and redirect), the `iss` mix-up rejection, client credentials, connect, filter, suggested requests, form and JSON execution, error responses, resources, prompts, log, diagnostics, theme, saved servers, timeouts and phone-width layout.
- **compliance**: the spec compliance rule engine (`src/core/compliance/`), which grades recorded exchanges against the protocol version a server claims. Covers the catalogue format, rule selection by version, best effort for unknown versions, error isolation and determinism.
- **tooling**: the repository's own scripts (the traceability check, the README check, the governance files, the Makefile's install contract) run as real processes or against throwaway fixture trees.

The mock server (`tests/fixtures/mock-mcp-server.mjs`) should fail the same ways real servers do. New misbehaviour is a new scenario in `tests/fixtures/mock/scenarios/`, served on `/scenario/<name>/mcp`, not a new top-level path. `startMock({ port: 0 })` gives each test its own instance.

## Acceptance criteria

Every roadmap issue states its behaviour as Given/When/Then acceptance criteria with stable IDs. They live as tagged Gherkin scenarios in `docs/acceptance/v<milestone>/<ISSUE-KEY>.feature`, and a test covers one when its title starts with the ID:

```js
test('AC-QA-TRACE-01: covered AC passes', () => { /* ... */ });
```

`npm run test:trace` fails on a criterion with no test, a test naming an unknown criterion, a duplicated ID, or an `@pending` criterion still untested once `package.json` reaches its milestone. `--format=json` prints the same report as JSON.

## CI gates, and how to run them locally

| CI job | What it checks | Locally |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Test (Node 22, 24) | Every suite, including e2e with Chromium, which fails rather than skips when `CI=true`; a JUnit report per Node version, uploaded, with failing tests by acceptance criterion in the job summary | `npm run test:ci` (writes `reports/junit-node<major>.xml`) |
| Test (Node 22, 24) | Every acceptance criterion has a test | `npm run test:trace` |
| Test (Node 22, 24) | The build and its self-checks; nothing under `src/core/` imports a `node:` module or a Cloudflare-only API | `make build` |
| Test (Node 22, 24) | A staged install puts the `mcp-tester` command in place | `make DESTDIR=/tmp/stage install` |
| Test (Node 22, 24) | No known vulnerability, and valid registry signatures | `npm audit && npm audit signatures` |
| Test (Node 22, 24) | The build is reproducible: a rebuild from a fresh export is byte-identical | see the CI step |
| Dependency review (pull requests) | No new dependency with a known vulnerability | not local |
| CodeQL | Static analysis of every JavaScript file (security-extended queries) | not local |
| Devcontainer (when it changes, and weekly) | The devcontainer builds and the full suite passes inside it | open the repository in a container |
| Scorecard (`main`, weekly) | OpenSSF Scorecard, published to code scanning | not local |
| Docs lint | Markdown style | `npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"` |
| Docs lint | Spelling | `codespell` (from `pip install codespell`) |
| Docs lint | README section order, no unfilled template tokens | `npm run check:readme` |
| Docs lint | Every relative link and anchor in the Markdown resolves | `make links` |
| Docs lint | The user manual builds in strict mode (a broken link or anchor fails it) | `make docs` |

The docs-lint tools and MkDocs run in CI only; they are not project dependencies. `pre-commit install` runs markdownlint, codespell and the README, link and version checks before each commit (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, hooks pinned by commit), and the devcontainer (`.devcontainer/`) boots to a working `npm test`, end-to-end tests included. MkDocs is pinned by hash in `docs/manual/requirements.txt` ([ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-manual-with-mkdocs.md)).

## Releases

Every release increments the version by exactly 0.0.1 and is built from `feat/v<next-version>` (see [`docs/POLICIES.md`](docs/POLICIES.md#versioning)). `.github/workflows/release.yml` does the rest when a signed tag is pushed.

**Before tagging**, on the release branch:

1. Bump the version everywhere it appears: `package.json`, `package-lock.json` (`npm install --package-lock-only`), `CLIENT_INFO` in `src/ui/js/state.js`, and "currently X.Y.Z" in the README. `make versions` and `make readme` fail until they all agree.
2. Move the `Unreleased` entries in `CHANGELOG.md` under a `## [X.Y.Z] - <date>` heading.
3. Write `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`: the release's two to four highlights ([format](docs/releases/README.md)).
4. Merge the release pull request into `main`.

**Tagging** is done by a maintainer, on `main`, with a signed annotated tag whose message is exactly `MCP Tester vX.Y.Z`:

```sh
git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "MCP Tester vX.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

**The workflow then**, in order, and stops at the first failure:

1. Checks the tag: annotated, signed and verified by GitHub, message `MCP Tester vX.Y.Z`, pointing at a commit on `main`, and every version reference and the changelog heading match it.
2. Builds `dist/`, a CycloneDX SBOM (`npm sbom`) and `SHA256SUMS` over every file.
3. Attests build provenance for every file and binds the SBOM to them, both signed with Sigstore.
4. Composes the notes (the highlights, GitHub's list of merged pull requests, the checksums, the full changelog link) and publishes the release.
5. Reads the release back: downloads every file, checks it against `SHA256SUMS` and its provenance, and checks the notes and the tag signature.

**A dry run** does everything except publish: it runs on pull requests that change the release machinery, and by hand from the Actions tab. Its files and notes are kept as a workflow artifact, and the notes appear in the run summary.

The user manual is published to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/docs.yml` for the same tag.

## Deploying to Cloudflare by hand

Paste `dist/worker.js` into the Worker's dashboard editor, selecting and deleting all existing code first. A paste on top of leftover code once caused a confusing `Unexpected identifier` error.
